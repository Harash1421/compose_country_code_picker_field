To utilize CountryPickerField in your Composable function:


```kotlin
@ExperimentalMaterial3Api
@Composable
public fun CountryCodePickerField(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    secondStyle: Boolean = false,
    value: String,
    onValueChange: (String) -> Unit,
    textStyle: TextStyle = TextStyle(color = Color.Black, fontSize = 17.sp),
    textFieldColors: TextFieldColors = TextFieldDefaults.outlinedTextFieldColors(
        focusedBorderColor = Color.Black,
        unfocusedBorderColor = Color.White,
        cursorColor = Color.Black

var phoneNumber by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

val getPhoneNumber = remember { mutableStateOf("") }

val textFieldColors = TextFieldDefaults.outlinedTextFieldColors(

    unfocusedBorderColor = Color.White,
    unfocusedBorderColor = Color.White,
)

CountryCodePickerField(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(25.dp).background(Color.White),
    secondStyle = false,
    value = phoneNumber,
    onValueChange = { phoneNumber = it },
    textStyle = TextStyle(color = Color.Black, fontSize = 17.sp),
    textFieldColors = textFieldColors,
    showCountryFlag = true,
    showCountryCode = true
)

Text(text = getPhoneNumber.value)

Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(24.dp))

Button(onClick = {
  getPhoneNumber.value = fullPhoneNumber
}) {
  Text(text = "Get Phone Number")
